Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT and the ACT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. Lately, more and more schools are opting to drop the SAT/ACT requirement for their Fall 2021 applications ([*read more about this here*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-colleges-sat-act-test-trnd/index.html))."

        "2. Visualize distributions using histograms. If you have a lot, consider writing a custom function and use subplots.\n",
        "    - *OPTIONAL*: Summarize the underlying distributions of your features (in words & statistics)\n",
        "         - Be thorough in your verbal description of these distributions.\n",
        "         - Be sure to back up these summaries with statistics.\n",
        "         - We generally assume that data we sample from a population will be normally distributed. Do we observe this trend? Explain your answers for each distribution and how you think this will affect estimates made from these data.\n",
        "3. Plot and interpret boxplots. \n",
        "    - Boxplots demonstrate central tendency and spread in variables. In a certain sense, these are somewhat redundant with histograms, but you may be better able to identify clear outliers or differences in IQR, etc.\n",
        "    - Multiple values can be plotted to a single boxplot as long as they are of the same relative scale (meaning they have similar min/max values).\n",
        "    - Each boxplot should:\n",
        "        - Only include variables of a similar scale\n",
        "        - Have clear labels for each variable\n",
        "        - Have appropriate titles and labels\n",
        "4. Plot and interpret scatter plots to view relationships between features. Feel free to write a custom function, and subplot if you'd like. Functions save both time and space.\n",
        "    - Your plots should have:\n",
        "        - Two clearly labeled axes\n",
        "        - A proper title\n",
