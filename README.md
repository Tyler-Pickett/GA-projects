Project 3:
In week four we learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we learned about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project will put those skills to the test.
For project 3, our goal is two-fold:Using an API, we collected posts from two subreddits of your choosing. We then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.

Project 4:
A one day hackathon

Project 5:
Renewable Energy Sector Momentum Analysis; with time series, ARIMA, and VAR modeling
